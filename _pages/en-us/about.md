<h4 align="left"><b>Pleased to meet you! ‚úåÔ∏è üôÇ </b> </h4>

<p>I am a physicist from the National University of Colombia, where I learned a lot about mathematics and numerical methods. My primary interests lie in programming, particularly in the realm of physical simulations with a focus on sound waves and sound production. I have been extensively exploring the numerical analysis techniques for solving ordinary and partial differential equations, encompassing data creation, pre-processing, post-processing, and visualization. Additionally, I am intrigued by how does sound is produced in animals and objects and the application of machine learning concepts in physics, specially in bioacustics.</p>

<p>At present, 2025, I have started my master's degree in computer science at the <a href="https://www.ime.usp.br/">Institute of Mathematics and Statistics (IME)</a> at the University of Sao Paulo (USP), Brazil. Here, I aim to deepen my knowledge of computer science and programming, enhance my analytical skills, and refine my programming and modeling abilities. Regarding research, I intend to continue studying bioacoustics, delve deeper into bird sound analysis, and explore the sound production of other animals. I am working on improving the birdsongs package, which has migrated to <a href="https://wavesongs.github.io/wavesongs/">wavesongs</a>, by adding new functionalities, enhancing the package structure, and exploring other sound production systems.</p>

<h4>Hobbies</h4>

<p>I am an adventurous person who loves trying new things and experiences. I particularly enjoy traveling ‚úàÔ∏è and biking üö≤. Recently, I've developed a passion for listening to music üéß, and I challenge myself to discover at least two new songs every week.</p>

<p>I enjoy living in Bogot√° because it is a large city with countless opportunities and cultural events. One of my favorite places is the <a href="https://cinematecadebogota.gov.co/">Cinemateca</a> üé•, where I have watched incredible and stunning independent movies, each presenting a unique and impactful story. Additionally, Bogot√° hosts a wide variety of concerts üèüÔ∏è featuring diverse genres. The city is home to major outdoor events such as <a href="https://www.rockalparque.gov.co/">Rock al Parque</a>, <a href="https://salsaalparque.gov.co/">Salsa al Parque</a>, <a href="https://hiphopalparque.gov.co/">Hip Hop al Parque</a>, and <a href="https://www.idartes.gov.co/es/noticias/bogota-anuncia-las-fechas-de-los-festivales-al-parque-2024">many others</a>, including jazz, gospel, joropo, and vallenato festivals.</p>

<p>Regarding sports, I am not a big fan, although I do enjoy hiking üèûÔ∏è, biking üö¥, and playing soccer tennis ‚öΩ. In the latter, I can be quite a challenging opponent. Another interesting hobby of mine is my passion for recording sounds üê¶üéôÔ∏è of all kinds. The weirder the sound, the more intriguing it is to me. I have developed a particular interest in the sounds of animals, especially birds, frogs, monkeys, and any other creatures that produce unique sounds.</p>
