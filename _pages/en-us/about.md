Pleased to meet you!

I am physicist from the National University of Colombia where I have studied physics and mathematics theories. Currently, I am interested in any kind of programming problems but especially in everything related to physical simulations, in particular sound waves. I have been studying how to solve ODEs and PDEs using numerical analysis (learning about data creation, pre and pos processing data, and visualization) and also how to use Machine Learning ideas in physics.

I have developed the following skills in my bachelor's degree:

- Data analysis.
- Mathematical thinking.
- Good communication skills for teamwork.
- High adaptability to software working environments.
- Proficiency in Python, Matlab, Latex, and Github.
- Wide knowledge about numerical analysis.
- Basic knowledge about Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and server communication (SSH).
- Fluent english.


If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me.

Have a great day! üòÅ
