<h5 align="center"><b>Pleased to meet you! ✌️ 🙂 </b> </h5> 

<p>I am a physicist from the National University of Colombia, where I learned a lot about mathematics and numerical methods. My primary interests lie in programming, particularly in the realm of physical simulations with a focus on sound waves and sound production. I have been extensively exploring the numerical analysis techniques for solving ordinary and partial differential equations, encompassing data creation, pre-processing, post-processing, and visualization. Additionally, I am intrigued by how does sound is produced in animals and objects and the application of machine learning concepts in physics, specially in bioacustics.</p>

<h4>Hobbies</h4>

<p>I am an adventurous person who loves trying new things and experiences. I particularly enjoy traveling ✈️ and biking 🚲. Recently, I've developed a passion for listening to music 🎧, and I challenge myself to discover at least two new songs every week.</p>

<p>I enjoy living in Bogotá because it is a large city with countless opportunities and cultural events. One of my favorite places is the <a href="https://cinematecadebogota.gov.co/">Cinemateca</a> 🎥, where I have watched incredible and stunning independent movies, each presenting a unique and impactful story. Additionally, Bogotá hosts a wide variety of concerts 🏟️ featuring diverse genres. The city is home to major outdoor events such as <a href="https://www.rockalparque.gov.co/">Rock al Parque</a>, <a href="https://salsaalparque.gov.co/">Salsa al Parque</a>, <a href="https://hiphopalparque.gov.co/">Hip Hop al Parque</a>, and <a href="https://www.idartes.gov.co/es/noticias/bogota-anuncia-las-fechas-de-los-festivales-al-parque-2024">many others</a>, including jazz, gospel, joropo, and vallenato festivals.</p>

      <p style="margin: 4px;">Regarding sports, I am not a big fan, although I do enjoy hiking 🏞️, biking 🚴, and playing soccer tennis ⚽. In the latter, I can be quite a challenging opponent.</p>

      <p>Another interesting hobby of mine is my passion for recording sounds 🐦🎙️ of all kinds. The weirder the sound, the more intriguing it is to me. I have developed a particular interest in the sounds of animals, especially birds, frogs, monkeys, and any other creatures that produce unique sounds.</p>
      
      <p>Currently, I am exploring salsa, rock, and jazz music, but I always love discovering new music of any kind and origin. On the left side are some of the music I am listening to now, maybe you will like some of them.</p>
