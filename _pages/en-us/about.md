<h5><b>Pleased to meet you! ‚úåÔ∏è </b> </h5> 

<p>I am a physicist from the National University of Colombia, where I learned a lot about mathematics and numerical methods. My primary interests lie in programming, particularly in the realm of physical simulations with a focus on sound waves and sound production. I have been extensively exploring the numerical analysis techniques for solving ordinary and partial differential equations, encompassing data creation, pre-processing, post-processing, and visualization. Additionally, I am intrigued by how does sound is produced in animals and objects and the application of machine learning concepts in physics, specially in bioacustics.</p>
