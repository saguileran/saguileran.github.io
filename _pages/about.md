<h4 align="left" style="margin: 2pt 0 10pt 0;"><i style="margin: 0 2pt 0 0;">Pleased to meet you!</i> 😁 ✌️</h4>

<p>I'm a M.Sc. student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.ime.usp.br/">Institute of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, University of São Paulo (IME-USP)</a>, conducting research in bioacoustics and dynamical systems. I hold a B.S. in Physics from the <a href="https://unal.edu.co/guc/">National University of Colombia (UNAL)</a>. My research journey spans from undergraduate summer research at the <a href="https://www.ece.udel.edu/">Electrical & Computer Engineering Department of the University of Delaware</a> (2021), where I applied digital signal processing to analyze underwater soundscapes, to my undergraduate internship for biological research at the <a href="https://www2.ifsc.usp.br/english/">Sao Carlos Physics Institute (IFSC-USP)</a> (2023), where I configured and ran molecular simulations and analyzed the resulting data. These diverse experiences have cultivated my interdisciplinary approach to computational science, focusing on mathematical modeling and data analysis.</p>

<h3>Research</h3>

<p>My passion centers on the physical modeling of sound, from its generation and propagation to its computational simulation using ordinary and partial differential equations as well as numerical methods. I combine computational physics, acoustics, and simulation techniques to develop models that capture real acoustic behavior while maintaining theoretical rigor and practical applicability. I leverage signal processing and machine learning tools strategically, viewing them as complementary to, rather than replacements for, deep physical understanding. I'm driven by the challenge of developing models that bridge theory and computation, particularly in bioacoustics where physical insight and data-driven methods converge most powerfully.</p>

<p>At present, I'm advancing research in bioacoustics, investigating bird vocalizations and acoustic signal analysis. I develop tools like <a href="https://wavesongs.github.io/">WaveSongs</a> to enable accessible, reproducible research within the scientific community. My work spans the complete acoustic pipeline, from computational modeling and simulation to visualization and data analysis. I'm particularly passionate about leveraging computational science to understand and conserve our fauna and biodiversity.</p>
