<h2>Origins</h2>

I was born and raised in [Bogotá](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bogot%C3%A1,+Col%C3%B4mbia/@4.6486206,-74.2729625,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x8e3f9bfd2da6cb29:0x239d635520a33914!8m2!3d4.7109886!4d-74.072092!16zL20vMDFkenlj?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI2MDEyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), Colombia, in 1996. While the official term is "bogotano," there's this cool local classification called "rolo"—basically someone whose parents aren't originally from Bogotá but moved here seeking better opportunities. Fourteen months later, my brother Néstor came along.

<h2>Family</h2>

My family consists of my brother and my parents. My brother Néstor is an awesome musician with an enormous passion and dedication for creating music. This year he's finally graduating as a professional guitar player. My mom Clara retired a few years ago—she worked hard and was able to study for a professional career as a professor. I guess that's where I got my passion for learning and research. For me, she is an amazing woman, capable of facing cancer while studying her career and taking care of her two sons. Awesome! My dad has always been a driver. Unfortunately, he didn't have opportunities to study due to his circumstances, but I think I inherited from him the love for traveling and discovering new places and cultures.

<h2>Education</h2>

I've always studied in public institutions, which has shaped my way of thinking and experiencing the world. Being conscious of the different social and political realities has been key to who I am. Thanks to the diversity of places I've been and people I've met, I've shared thousands of thoughts, learned from unique individuals, debated ideas, and obviously, defined myself as a person.

I studied at [Benjamin Herrera School](https://www.redacademica.edu.co/colegios/colegio-tecnico-benjamin-herrera-ied) in Bogotá. Then, wanting to continue my studies, I started a technological program at [SENA](https://www.sena.edu.co/es-co/Paginas/default.aspx), but left after six months—the questions I was asking myself couldn't be answered there. So I decided to take it a step further and pursue professional education. Based on my previous experiences, I chose to study electronic engineering at [Distrital Francisco José de Caldas University](https://www.udistrital.edu.co/inicio) at the [technology faculty](https://ftecnologica.udistrital.edu.co/inicio). I spent a year there and met one of my first loves. Although the education was great, and even better were the people and discussions, I found engineering itself terrible: the way of thinking, the business-focused courses, the research approach, the political stance—everything felt off. While studying there, I met an awesome professor, Ronaldo, a physicist from [UNAL](https://unal.edu.co/) with a spectacular teaching methodology, deep understanding of physics, and such politeness. I started stalking him (where he studied, what he researched, etc.) and discovered he was a doctor. That inspired me to follow the same path. So I applied to UNAL in 2015 and got admitted—and that's when the best journey of my life began: a bachelor's degree in physics at the best public university in Colombia. I talked, learned, studied, thought—I did everything and explored the world like never before, discovering new ways of thinking and beliefs I never knew existed. Best experience ever.

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<p>I am an adventurous person who loves trying new things and experiences. I particularly enjoy traveling ✈️ and biking 🚲. Recently, I've developed a passion for listening to music 🎧, and I challenge myself to discover at least two new songs every week.</p>

<p>I enjoy living in Bogotá because it is a large city with countless opportunities and cultural events. One of my favorite places is the <a href="https://cinematecadebogota.gov.co/">Cinemateca</a> 🎥, where I have watched incredible and stunning independent movies, each presenting a unique and impactful story. In fact, Sao Paulo has also a <a href="https://cinemateca.org.br/">Cinemateca Brasileira
</a>, awesome place with magnificent films and festivals!</p>

<p>Additionally, Bogotá hosts a wide variety of concerts 🏟️ featuring diverse genres. The city is home to major outdoor events such as <a href="https://www.rockalparque.gov.co/">Rock al Parque</a>, <a href="https://salsaalparque.gov.co/">Salsa al Parque</a>, <a href="https://hiphopalparque.gov.co/">Hip Hop al Parque</a>, and <a href="https://www.idartes.gov.co/es/noticias/bogota-anuncia-las-fechas-de-los-festivales-al-parque-2024">many others</a>, including jazz, gospel, joropo, and vallenato festivals.</p>

<p>Regarding sports, I am not a big fan, although I do enjoy hiking 🏞️, biking 🚴, and playing soccer tennis ⚽. In the latter, I can be quite a challenging opponent. Another interesting hobby of mine is my passion for recording sounds 🐦🎙️ of all kinds. The weirder the sound, the more intriguing it is to me. I have developed a particular interest in the sounds of animals, especially birds, frogs, monkeys, and any other creatures that produce unique sounds.</p>
