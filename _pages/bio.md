<h2>Origins</h2>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<p>I am an adventurous person who loves trying new things and experiences. I particularly enjoy traveling ✈️ and biking 🚲. Recently, I've developed a passion for listening to music 🎧, and I challenge myself to discover at least two new songs every week.</p>

<p>I enjoy living in Bogotá because it is a large city with countless opportunities and cultural events. One of my favorite places is the <a href="https://cinematecadebogota.gov.co/">Cinemateca</a> 🎥, where I have watched incredible and stunning independent movies, each presenting a unique and impactful story. Additionally, Bogotá hosts a wide variety of concerts 🏟️ featuring diverse genres. The city is home to major outdoor events such as <a href="https://www.rockalparque.gov.co/">Rock al Parque</a>, <a href="https://salsaalparque.gov.co/">Salsa al Parque</a>, <a href="https://hiphopalparque.gov.co/">Hip Hop al Parque</a>, and <a href="https://www.idartes.gov.co/es/noticias/bogota-anuncia-las-fechas-de-los-festivales-al-parque-2024">many others</a>, including jazz, gospel, joropo, and vallenato festivals.</p>

<p>Regarding sports, I am not a big fan, although I do enjoy hiking 🏞️, biking 🚴, and playing soccer tennis ⚽. In the latter, I can be quite a challenging opponent. Another interesting hobby of mine is my passion for recording sounds 🐦🎙️ of all kinds. The weirder the sound, the more intriguing it is to me. I have developed a particular interest in the sounds of animals, especially birds, frogs, monkeys, and any other creatures that produce unique sounds.</p>

<h2>Music</h2>

<p>Currently, I am exploring salsa, rock, and jazz music, but I always love discovering new music of any kind and origin. On the left side are some of the music I am listening to now, maybe you will like some of them.</p>
