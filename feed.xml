M. Meirelles</a> at the <a href="https://www.ime.usp.br/">Institute of Mathematics and Statistics (IME)</a> at the <a href="https://www5.usp.br/">University of São Paulo (USP)</a>. The course is designed and maintained by the research group <a href="https://flusp.ime.usp.br/">FLUSP</a>. You can find all tutorials and more detailed information on its official webpage. More information about the course (content, references, etc.) can be found on the official website Janus for the courses, <a href="https://uspdigital.usp.br/janus/componente/disciplinasOferecidasInicial.jsf?action=3&amp;sgldis=MAC5856">MAC5856 - Desenvolvimento de Software Livre</a>.</p> <p>The objective of the course is to introduce students to free and open source software. In Portuguese, both terms mean the same. The course covers basic concepts, appropriate languages, ethical and technical aspects, etc., with the goal of promoting and constructing open and collaborative software. The course focus is to learn and contribute to open projects like the Linux kernel for the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.14/driver-api/iio/index.html">IIO subsystem</a>.</p> <p>In addition, there is a new tool implemented for the VMs developement and linux modules design, creation, and testing. The tool is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kw</code>, a kernel developer workflow tool. More information can be found at <a href="https://kworkflow.org/">kworkflow</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>NOTE</strong></p> <p>The course focuses its tutorials and practices on the Linux kernel subsystem <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.16/driver-api/iio/index.html">Industrial I/O (IIO)</a>. This subsystem is designed for handling sensors and other devices that provide analog-to-digital or digital-to-analog data conversion, making it a critical component for industrial and embedded systems. <em>The device used for the course is a Lenovo laptop with Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS.</em></p> </blockquote> <hr/> <h2 id="tutorial-1-setting-up-a-test-environment-for-linux-kernel">Tutorial 1: Setting up a test environment for Linux Kernel</h2> <p>The first tutorial of the course provides an introduction to <a href="https://github.com/QEMU">QEMU</a> and <a href="https://github.com/libvirt">libvirt</a>, powerful tools designed to deploy virtual machines (VMs) quickly and efficiently, eliminating the traditional complexities and time-consuming efforts typically associated with VM setup. Both QEMU and libvirt are libraries used for virtualization and resource emulation, enabling users to create and manage virtualized environments with ease.</p> <p>The Linux kernel architecture tested is an ARM for the industrial I/O subsystem (IIO).</p> <p>A detailed guide can be found at: <a href="https://flusp.ime.usp.br/kernel/qemu-libvirt-setup/">Setting up a test environment for Linux Kernel Dev using QEMU and libvirt</a> writtten by <a href="https://linux.ime.usp.br/~marcelosc/">Marcelo Schmitt</a>.</p> <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3> <p>The tutorial is divided into the following sections:</p> <ol> <li>Preparing testing environment directory and “all-in-one” script <ul> <li>Create necessary folders and files.</li> <li>Give the required permissions for files and folders.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Set up and configure a VM running a guest OS <ul> <li>Create an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">activate.sh</code> file to deploy VMs manager. To enable it, execute the comand <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">home/lk_dev/activate.sh</code> or, located in the folder <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lk_dev</code> use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.activate.sh</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">soruce activate.sh</code>, this will print some green text and a pink prompt preamble to indicate you are in the VM’s manager.</li> <li>Check image OS properties and partition size, then resize the disk image to 5Gb to give space for more linux modules.</li> <li>Extract kernel and initrd images from OS image to create the VM with them</li> <li>Activate the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libvirt</code> damen to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">virsh</code> commands. In addition, starts a default network (to connect the VM with internet) with virsh. It will also enable autostart and persistence for the network.</li> <li>The output for the point, is a bash function that creates a VM named arm64 that creates a VM with some default configuration defined in the activate file.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Configure SSH access from the host to the VM. <ul> <li>Allow ssh connection with the current VM’s credentials, user root without password. There are two important settigns you must done: enable permit root login and permit empty password. This its done by modifying the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> file.</li> <li>Reconfigure the sshd keys and restart the sshd damon.</li> <li>Now, it is possible to connect to the VM machine via ssh, using a client-server approach. Furthermore, it is possible to sent and recive files using Secure Copy Protocol (scp).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Fetch the modules loaded in the guest kernel. <ul> <li>Export the modules installed. To keep the same machine in every moment, it is highly recommended to create a file with the modules used, this can be done wiht <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lsmod &gt; vm_mod_list</code>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Set up host &lt;-&gt; VM file sharing (optional) <ul> <li>This part was tried but for now is not working. After implemented the changes suggested (memory backing and file system configurations) the machine does not work, it does not boot.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <blockquote> <h4 id="useful-commands"><strong>Useful Commands</strong></h4> <ul> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lsmod</code> - Show the status of modules in the Linux Kernel, more info <a href="https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man8/lsmod.8.html">here</a>.</li> <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create_vm_virsh</code> - To create a VM with the kernel, initrd, and memory defined in the activate file.

This should be executed together iwth destroy.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3> <h4 id="ssh-configuration">SSH Configuration</h4> <p>In the part 3, if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/ssh/</code> folder is missing, it indicates that SSH is not installed on the system. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Update and upgrade the system packages:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt update <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">sudo </span>apt upgrade
</code></pre></div> </div> </li> <li> <p>Install the OpenSSH server package to enable SSH functionality:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>openssh-server
</code></pre></div> </div> </li> </ol> <p>This will download and configure the necessary SSH dependencies, allowing you to establish an SSH connection.</p> <h4 id="destroying-vm">Destroying VM</h4> <p>There is a minor issue when destroying and undefining the VM. After the machine is killed, it may freeze when using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">virsh start</code> command and fail to display the login prompt. However, you can still access the VM via SSH. To resolve this, ensure the VM is properly shut down before destroying it, and verify the VM’s state using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">virsh list --all</code>. If the issue persists, consider restarting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libvirt</code> service:</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>systemctl restart libvirtd
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Additionally, check the VM’s configuration and logs for any inconsistencies that might cause the freeze. The image below shows the problem.</p> <div class="row mt-3" style="width:80%; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/flusp/vm_1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/flusp/vm_1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/flusp/vm_1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/flusp/vm_1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> An error occurred during the tutorial after destroying the VM and creating it again. </div> <h4 id="shared-memory">Shared Memory</h4> <p>To edit the VM configuration use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EDITOR=vim; virsh edit arm64</code>. As mentioned before, after implemented the suggested configurations the machine does not work, there is an available blog to solve the shared memory issue: <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/virt-manager-cannot-find-virtiofsd/26752/9">Virt-manager cannot find virtiofsd - discourse.nixos</a>. It was tested but does not work`</p> <h3 id="comments">Comments</h3> <p>Although the tutorial introduced powerful tools, their usage is clearly detailed, making them accessible and easy to follow. In my experience, the challenging part was managing the VM with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">virsh</code>, as a domain must be properly defined and either closed or shut down to after using, or reset to update changes. On the other hand, despite being an Ubuntu user, I found the image types (qcow2), kernel, initrd, and VM building processes to be entirely new concepts. Considering the environment setup, it was fascinating to define a simple environment with constants and functions, which is somewhat similar to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code> file in Ubuntu for managing user-specific shell configurations.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>ADVICE:</strong> Always is requireted to restart the environment after make a change in the activate.sh file.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="parctical-excersie-ubuntu-jammy-and-amd64-kernels">Parctical excersie: Ubuntu Jammy and AMD64 kernels</h3> <p>As a practical exercise, let’s try to create a VM using the same Debian version but for an AMD64 architecture.

The kernel is customized and then booted. The source code is obtained from the Linux community and loaded into memory or hardware, with or without virtualization. Four our case since server and host are sharing the resource the VM uses virtualization. The tutorial also explains what a kernel module is and how it can be written, loaded, and unloaded in the system.</p> <p>An important concept introduced is <em>Cross-compilation</em>, a process where code is compiled on one architecture but executed on another. In our case, we use x64 or x86 host systems to compile and test ARM64 systems. Although these architectures differ significantly, the key distinction is that ARM is designed for devices like smartphones and tablets, while x64/x86 systems are typically used in laptops and desktops. ARM offers several advantages, such as energy efficiency, low battery consumption, and performance comparable to common x64 systems.</p> <p>Finally, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kw</code> software is introduced. This software enables fast and efficient creation and management of virtual machines (VMs), significantly reducing the effort required for setup and configuration.</p> <p>A detailed guide can be found at: <a href="https://flusp.ime.usp.br/kernel/build-linux-for-arm-kw/">Building and booting a custom Linux kernel for ARM using kw</a> written by <a href="https://davidbtadokoro.tech/">David Tadokoro</a>.</p> <h3 id="summary-1">Summary</h3> <ol> <li>Installing kw <ul> <li>Clone the official <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kw</code> repository <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow.git</code> and switch for the unstable branch, this branch is also very stable and contains new updates created for the developers that are not included in the main branch.</li> <li>Install the software by executing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setup.sh --full-installation</code>. The flag passed for the isntallation script is for including tne dependencies installation.</li> <li>To update kw use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kw self-update</code> if is the main branch, in other case add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--unestable</code> for update the pacakge respect the unestable branch.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Cloning a Linux kernel tree <ul> <li>Linux kernels can be found in many official places. These repositories are also known as <em>trees</em>, because the software designed is a tree-like hierarchy. You can get more information of the linux by looking the version name. The most updated official tree versions are known as <em>mainline</em>, also as Linus Torvalds’s tree.</li> <li>Download the IIO subsystem tree by cloning the repo <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jic23/iio.git</code>. This repository contains a huge quantity of comments and weveral branches, since it is a educational excersie is enough to download a single branch (testing) and a few commits, the last 10 for example. This is done using git and its flags.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Configure kw in a local context for IIO development <ul> <li>Initialize <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kw</code>.

These files contains information about the modules configurations, between other stuff. In most of the directories of the kernel there are always a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Kconfig</code> file, furthermore there are default configurations, know as <em>deconfig</em> files. In this part, we create default configurations and then update them with new values, both actiosn are executed with make. To do it, the modules list created in the first tutorial is passed to make, to keep the same modules eviroment and make debugging easer.</li> <li>It is possible to edit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.config</code> files directly although it is not recommended. Instead, a safer and more practical way is to use a Terminal User Interfaces (TUI) provided by kw. It is done with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kw build --menu</code>. The TUI has many advantages specially for new users. To test the TUI a change in the kernel image is done, expanding or modying it. To verify the change check the building information using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kw build --info</code>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Building a custom Linux kernel <ul> <li>At present there are many manufactures for hardware with different architectures, where everyone has different instructions for reading and integration. As result, it is necesarry to donwload a suitable GCC compiler, for ARM64 architecture.

It is always required when modifying or adding modules.</li> <li>Update the activate script with the new kernel in the launch and create functions. Then, activate or reload the main environment.</li> <li>To implement the changes done it is required to poweroff the VM and remove it from the virsh manager. Then, create it again using the new kernel configurations.</li> <li>Start the VM and check if the changes were sucessfully. This can be done by verifying the kernel version information with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uname --kernel-realse</code>. You have to see the new name with the modifitacion done.</li> <li>For kernel developers the final step is to install the kernel in the machine. This is done via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make install</code>.

After creating the simple example module, the configuration symbols were added, but the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simple_mod</code> module was not included in the list of build objects. As a result, when attempting to test the module, it failed to load and did not function as expected. This minor error highlights the importance of both steps: configuring symbols and ensuring they are added to the list of build objects.</p> <p>Another issue encountered was related to shutting down and unmanaging the VM. When the VM is shut down and removed from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kw</code> environment, the SSH connection is forgotten. Although it is still possible to connect using a standard SSH command, it is highly recommended to reconfigure the connection through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kw</code> for a smoother workflow.</p> <h3 id="comments-2">Comments</h3> <p>It was clear how the basic functions of the modules, such as the initialization (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">init</code>) and cleanup (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exit</code>) functions, operate. However, a deeper analysis requires more advanced knowledge of the C programming language and hardware interactions. The use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kw</code> significantly simplifies the configuration process by automatically identifying the kernel image and the IIO tree path.</p> <p>One of the most valuable insights from the results is understanding how the functions are invoked. With the addition of a second module that calls the simple module, the driver messages displayed using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dmesg</code> provide a chronological log of function calls. This log demonstrates the order in which drivers are loaded, reflecting the sequence in which they are listed.</p> <p>It is worth noting that the addition and configuration of modules are performed outside the VM, within the activated environment, directly in the Linux kernel directory. In contrast, the testing and verification of these modules are conducted within the VM environment.</p> <div class="row mt-3" style="width:80%; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/posts/flusp/vm_2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/posts/flusp/vm_2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/posts/flusp/vm_2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/posts/flusp/vm_2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Example of the <b>menuconfig</b> interface after enabling the custom module. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="tutorial-4-introduction-to-linux-kernel-character-device-drivers">Tutorial 4: Introduction to Linux kernel Character Device Drivers</h2> <p>This tutorial provides an introduction to Linux character devices, complemented by a practical example: a basic character driver.

The objective is to contribute to the Linux kernel’s IIO subsystem or DRM AMD subsystem. The task involves creating and submitting a patch (similar to a commit) to the official Linux kernel repository using the corresponding latest developer branch. This process is carried out via a mailing list. To send the email, Git is utilized. For detailed instructions, refer to <a href="#tutorial-6-sending-patches-by-email-with-git">Tutorial 6: Sending patches by email with git</a>.</p> <p>Since students are not required to have deep knowledge of the Linux kernel and its subsystems, the patches suggested by the professor and mentors involve simple modifications to the code. These include code style corrections (though these are less likely to be accepted), removing duplicate code, eliminating unused functions, making small improvements, or other straightforward changes.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The goal is to practice creating and submitting patches to the Linux kernel mailing list, not necessarily to have them accepted in the same course period. The focus is on understanding the workflow, adhering to coding standards, and communicating with maintainers.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="iio-subsystem">IIO Subsystem</h3> <p>A simple patch to start contributing is removing duplicate code or functions.

My contributions included:</p> <h3 id="1-resolution-of-issue-1">1. Resolution of Issue <a href="https://github.com/LipArcanjo/arkanjo/issues/1">#1</a></h3> <p>This issue concerned a color rendering bug in the output text results. The original implementation was optimized for dark terminal backgrounds, resulting in poor contrast and visibility when used with light themes. My solution involved:</p> <ul> <li>Implementing two distinct color sets for light and dark terminal backgrounds</li> <li>Creating three platform-specific utility files: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">linux_utils</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">windows_utils</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apple_utils</code>. Each file contains a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UtilsOSDependable</code> class with functions to: <ul> <li>Detect terminal background color (in RGB format)</li> <li>Parse rgb colors and covert them to float data type</li> <li>Calculate color luminance (perceptual brightness)</li> <li>Others auxiliar functions</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The solution has been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 24) and Windows environments, with Apple platform testing pending.

However, since I had prior experience with Ubuntu, I was able to overcome these difficulties successfully—thanks in large part to the helpful monitors, whom I deeply appreciate.</p> <p>The first project proved difficult because I spent too much time deciding how to refactor the code. I initially chose to work on an IIO kernel patch with a simple but tricky change, which I implemented. However, my submission was rejected due to introduced warnings and errors. As a backup plan, I used Arkanjo to search for code duplications and discovered several in the AMD DMR subsystem. There, I removed nearly 500 lines of redundant code, and this time, my patch was accepted quickly.</p> <p>For the second part, I selected Arkanjo—a tool developed at IME—which I explored in depth. I resolved one issue and added robust documentation. While the code changes were applied, the documentation deployment remains pending because pushing to the official repository requires owner permissions, which I don’t have. As a solution, we proposed creating an organization, but this is still in progress.</p> <p>The final project workshop was well-structured and guided, so I encountered no major issues. Additionally, as supplementary work, I spoke with Professor Paulo about contributing to an open-source project from Colombia (scikit-maad), which was my primary motivation for taking the course. While my contributions are complete, they have yet to be published.</p> <p>Overall, I enjoyed the course because most of the work was hands-on, and the proposed activities provided an excellent introduction to contributing to both small and large open-source projects. The foundational theory was clear and helped clarify concepts like “free” vs. “open” software. The classes were engaging and productive, thanks to active discussions among students, professors, and monitors. Personally, I highly recommend this course.</p> <blockquote> <p>As a final comment I want to recommend the <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio"><strong>al-folio</strong></a> website theme, <em>“a beautiful, simple, clean, and responsive Jekyll theme for academics”</em>. It is a great tool with highly customing, look the deployed <a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/">website</a> for more information.</p> </blockquote>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="free software"/><category term="usp"/><category term="mac-courses"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Logbook and notes for the free software development course at USP, 2025-1]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Birds, birds, and more birds</title><link href="https://saguileran.github.io/blog/2024/birds_in_everywhere/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Birds, birds, and more birds"/><published>2024-06-24T21:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-24T21:01:00+00:00</updated><id>https://saguileran.github.io/blog/2024/birds_in_everywhere</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://saguileran.github.io/blog/2024/birds_in_everywhere/"><![CDATA[<p>This is an example post with image galleries.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/9-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/9-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/9-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/7-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/7-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/7-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all. </div> <p>Images can be made zoomable.

In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.
