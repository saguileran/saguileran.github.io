automate the generation of birdsongs from recorded samples. By integrating concepts from numerical analysis, signal processing, and numerical optimization, we formulate the problem as a minimization task to identify optimal parameters that accurately replicate the tempo-spectral features of original birdsongs. Our model undergoes extensive testing and evaluation, primarily focusing on the Rufous-collared Sparrow songs, achieving impressive results with relative errors in fundamental frequency below 2%. Additionally, we evaluate the model on the Ocellated Tapaculo and Mimus Gilvus species, known for their simpler songs. The results demonstrate the model’s robustness and versatility. To showcase its capabilities, we generate multiple syllables from a single recording, highlighting the model’s potential as a highly effective data augmentation technique for birdsongs. This novel approach addresses the challenge of data scarcity in birdsong analysis, contributing significantly to various fields such as biology, neuroscience, computer science, and ecology.","location":"Bogotá","icon":"fa-solid fa-book"}],"skills":[{"name":"Basic","level":"Basic","icon":"fa-solid fa-tree","keywords":["Arduino","SQL/Workbench","Eclipse, Netbeans","AWS, Google Cloud, Firebase"]},{"name":"Intermediate","level":"Intermediate","icon":"fa-solid fa-tree","keywords":["JS, HTML, CSS","Julia, C++, Java","Mathematica, Power BI","SSH, Github","Canva, Krita"]},{"name":"Advanced","level":"Advanced","icon":"fa-solid fa-tree","keywords":["Python, Matlab","Latex, Office, Markdown","Jupyter-Notebook/Lab","Linux, Windows, VSC","Moodle LMS"]}],"strengths":[{"name":"Strengths","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Hard Working","Eye of Detail","Fast Learning","Creative","Passion"]}],"languages":[{"language":"Spanish","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""},{"language":"Portuguese","fluency":"Intermediate","icon":""},{"language":"German","fluency":"A few words.","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Physics","icon":"fa-solid fa-atom","keywords":["Acoustics","Bioacoustics","Physical Simulations","Sound Production","Teaching","Dynamical Systems"]},{"name":"Computer Science","icon":"fa-solid fa-laptop","keywords":["Digital Signal Processing","Data Science and Analytics","Deep Learning","Numerical Methods","Optimization","PDEs and ODEs"]},{"name":"Hobbies","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Travel  ✈️, Ride Bike  🚲","Listenning Music  🎧","Recording Birdsongs  🐦‍⬛🎙️","Cinema  🎥, Concerts  🏟️, ","Soccer Tennis  ⚽","Beer 🍺, Wine 🍷"]}],"references":[{"name":"Prof. Francisco Gómez J.","icon":"fa-solid fa-laptop","university":"National University of Colombia (UNAL)","email":"fagomezj@unal.edu.co","reference":"Engineer and associate professor in the Mathematics Department at the National University of Colombia, Bogotá D.C.
